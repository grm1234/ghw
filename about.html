            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>I am from Summit, NJ, which is in the northeastern part of the state (about 40 mins outside of NYC). I have lived in the same house my whole life, 22 years. I am the middle of 5 children. My oldest brother is actually my cousin but my parent's adopted him (longish story). I have 3 nieces and a newphew who live a town over from me so I see them fairly often.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>In 2016 I graduated from Summit High School. A couple months later I shipped up to the Electric City to further my education at the University of Scranton. Those 4 years aboslutely flew by and in May of 2020 I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems. A couple moths later I, I was offered a role here at TCS and in Septemeber of 2020 my TCS career began.</p>

            <h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
            <p>I am a big sports fan. I greatly enjoy playing and watching the major sports here in the States and, when it comes to soccer, across the pond as well. My favorite sport is hockey. I played in high school and still play pick up when the opportunity arises. I am a proud NJ Devils fan and have gone plus continue to go to as many games as I can. When it comes to soccer I support the NY Red Bulls here at home and Liverpool Football Club when it comes to Europe.</p>
