    Submission for the Blog web pages project.
    
   This project was very fun (and very frustrating at times). It was my first time ever creating a web page. 
It was a good refresher for JavaScript and Html. I am getting much more comfortable with them now. When it 
comes to Bootstrap and Css, I was a little shaky at first considering Ive never used them on my own. 
Bootstrap was fairly simple. I enjoyed it very much. The installation was easy and I sort of figured out 
the altering of it. 
    I first tackled the Home page. I tried putting a cool TCS image that I found online as the background, 
but it too looked “cheap”. It was very pixelated and I was not satisfied. No matter what image I used from 
google, the same pixilation occurred. Therefore, I just chose to keep one picture normally sized to give 
the user that TCS feel. I was going to go with a blueish background considering the TCS logo I chose was 
blue but that made the page look too slipshod and immature. I like the grey color. Much more sophisticated 
in my opinion. 
    For the Blog page I chose the Blog format in Bootstrap. I like the look of it very much. The add an article 
function is not up to the standards I set for myself but it was a struggle just to get that. I was trying to get 
that as a base platform and then go from there. However, I must have been making the tiniest of mistakes because 
it took me a day to figure out. But, it works so cant complain too much. If we were focusing on functionality as 
well as design, when an article is added, it will take the place of the card in “Latest Blogs” whose topic it 
matches. When the user clicks “Continue reading”, they will be taken to the article. Besides that, I added links 
to TCS’s main website, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn profile. This gives the user access to TCS on all fronts.
  The About page suffered similar consequences to the Home page. I wanted the texts to be in front of the 
images they correspond to. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the right combination of color and shadow to make 
the text clearly legible while also being professional. I opted to go with wrapping the text around the 
images. This got the point across without sacrificing any quality. I included a couple facts about myself 
and my interests. Somehow the background color splits halfway down the page. I scoured my css file for a 
long time and could not find where the problem was unfortunately. However, the colors are similar enough so 
it doesn’t diminish the page quality that much.
    Finally, the Contact page. This page gave me the most trouble. Initially, I used a form from Bootstrap that 
fit very well. However, like the add article function, I could not figure out how to get the errors to pop 
up. I tried everything, and for some reason it just would not work. I decided to just start from scratch, 
this time without bootstrap. This time it worked. I made the form similar to the one we did as a group so it 
looks professional. When I went to try and incorporate it with a bootstrap example I couldn’t get it to look 
presentable enough. I sacrificed bootstrap to ensure a clean look for the user. The contact form is succeeded
by a “Success” page which has the navigation bar at the top so the user can go to any page they wish.
    All in all, I am happy with my work. I greatly enjoyed making the web pages. It made me feel like a 
professional programmer, even though I am aware these are just baby steps. I look forward to making more 
complex web pages that will benefit a client and or peer.
